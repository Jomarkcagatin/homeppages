    <h2>“Being a family means you are a part of something very wonderful. It means you will love and be loved for the rest of your life.”</h2>

    <p>We are six siblings in our family. I have three brothers and two sisters, along with my parents. My mother is a housewife and takes care of us at home. My father is a farmer. One of my sisters is working as a manager in a furniture company, and the other sister is working as a company store checklist. Two of my brothers are studying Marine Engineering at the Philippine Maritime Institute, and one is in senior high school. The other brother already has a family.

    I am the youngest member of our family. We are a close-knit family, living together and loving each other a lot. We have a lot of fun together. My parents are really kind and interesting individuals. They have an impressive behavior towards others and love to help people. They have a good relationship with our neighbors. Both of my parents are religious and guide us on the right path.</p>
